I wrote my first blog about the CLI Gem project on October 3, 2020, nearly 3 years after first being accepted as a self-paced student online at Flatiron School. Today, I need to graduate by June 30, 2021.

## Fear of failure, fear of success

This project is a microcosm of my experience with learning as an adult - I was afraid I was too late and I continuously chose not to deal with it. I've been so afraid of failure that I've practically invited it. With this blog post, I am setting the strong intentions to both succeed and to graduate.

My recollection after posting that first project blog was that I took some actual steps towards getting a good start. I joined the Slack channel for the project and expressed my desire to complete the project. Another student pointed me toward their blog where they had put in some links to API collections and I felt a bit better. With the "blank page" problem staring me in the face, and my fun, easy "solve a lab" experience behind me, I originally chose an easy out - there was an API that served up amateur radio callsign information; it's how I realized I have to resubmit my license to the FCC this year!

I wasn't excited about this option because it really didn't capture my imagination. It's been a classic problem with my desire to succeed as a developer - I haven't developed a good process for generating ideas! In the meantime, the weather in Minnesota was starting to get colder and I spent quite a lot of my time on [weather.gov](http://weather.gov), obsessively checking what the weather conditions were going to be like so I could plan when I wanted to run. 

## Beyond the "blank page"

I'm sure I could check GitHub to see when the lightbulb finally clicked on that scraping my favorite weather page was the obvious fit for a project. Once decided, I descended into the delightful business of finding a geolocation API to figure out proper values for my location, evaluating and changing which specific page I wanted to scrape, and discovering just how to do what I wanted to do.

There's a lot of blur in the time between October and December. I know somewhere in that timeframe, I decided I was finally done. I swiveled my laptop to show my adoring husband my success - and FAIL! The National Weather Service was doing maintenance on that page type, which I figured out 2 days later, but I immediately hit the panic button. **WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO?!?! I WAS ALMOST DONE!!** Interestingly, that's when I discovered NWS had an API already! A few days later, after crying and screaming (*yes, I recognize that I'm about 40 years too old for that!*), I found my page had come back online. In the meantime, I realized there were a few problems I couldn't solve and began "The First Great Refactor". I attended a few study groups to ensure I was doing things right but I kind of dallied a bit getting things updated and put together.

## Being in action

Then **THE EMAIL** arrived letting us know that we needed to complete the program by the end of June. I panicked for but a moment then got to work. In the handful of days since **THE EMAIL**, I have:
1. Made a plan to get the requirements fulfilled for my project.
1. Set a plan to complete the rest of the program.
1. Located and purchased a tool that worked for me for charting my process flow.
1. Identified tools for my "coding session" (I missed that I was supposed to do it WHILE I was coding) and demo.
1. Spoke with an ed coach (sorry current job, thanks for letting me clear those 30 minutes!)
1. Cleared all other learning goals I was trying to tackle at the same time (I love learning but need to learn to love finishing!).
1. Completed my process flow diagram within 4 days with my new, better for me tool.

It's Friday night and I'll probably record my coding session - I found another feature I could implement! - and the demo. I could even submit my checklist so I can review my project and see what I need to do to pass. I will have **FINISHED**!

**I'm will keep going, I will finish, I will succeed.**
