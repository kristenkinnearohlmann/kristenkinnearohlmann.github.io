So....I let 3 weeks lapse since I entered Flatiron School.

What??

You see, I let myself come up with plenty of excuses!
1. It's the holidays.
2. I'll start when I have more time.
3. I couldn't get some of the work without using the technical coach - maybe I'm stupid.
4. I did a lot of hard work at the hackathon, reading technical articles and going to meetups.
4. I'll spend some time re-learning other concepts.
5. I'll let things soak in a bit.

It's funny, all of these excuses are the type of thing I learned how to manage in my _Learning How to Learn_ course, but I blew past it anyway. I had to keep gently nudging myself towards getting back on the horse.

When this snow day appeared in Minneapolis, keeping me from my evening rehearsal I thought, _"Aha! This is my chance!"._ And proceeded to procrastinate anyway.

Finally, I opened up the browser, set my cap to just work my way through the CSS graffiti lab however I could - and solved tag 6 in 15 minutes. Then solved tag 7 in 2 minutes. Whoa!

Had I just buckled down earlier, I may have saved myself 3 weeks. Or, maybe not. The thing is, it takes the time it takes, every path is different, and I did exactly what I needed to do to learn.

Just keep working the process!
