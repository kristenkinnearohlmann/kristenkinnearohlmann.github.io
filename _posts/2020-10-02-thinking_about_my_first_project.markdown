I have been spending a lot of time thinking about my first project. I know once its done, I will feel more able to move on. Right now, I just can't get started. I can accept failing but I can't accept being unable to start. I keep hoping that I will find myself with enough time to really get moving.

I felt more confident grinding away on the labs just before this because someone else ensured all the parts were there for me to discover. Inthis project, I have to discover the part before I can grind away on the solution.

I am committing strongly to making a cogent start on the project this week - Saturday or Sunday. I will at least create a page in Notion devoted to the project and start gathering my resources in one place.
