There is nothing truer than the statement "No one gets there alone." This is something I've been reflecting on a lot during this final project where the previously unknown concepts of React and Rails, Javascript and APIs, CSS beauty and HTML framework all come together.

Whether a project is simple like mine or complex as Facebook, a person or people worked hard with their creativity and passion to build something they and others would love. In my Flatiron journey, I have come to love the blooming of knowledge in my mind, the joy of a problem solved, and the confidence of achieving goals large and small.

When my organization participated in a hackathon just a few months ago in March, one of my colleagues suggested React even though neither he nor the other developer had worked with it. I knew it was coming up on the horizon for me so I readily agreed. I was still working through Sinatra at that point in my journey. After bashing my head against a wall trying to help and prove I had learned something to my colleagues, I ended up just jamming in someone else's code (in the form of a chart based on data the others were able to feed in), relegating myself to CSS stylist and team leader. I was worried for the future.

In the intervening time, I have come to meet and know so many other self-paced students and instructors. Each and every one of them have given me gifts - their time, their energy, sharing of joys and trials, gentle encouragement of moving to the next level, and celebration.

The future is now...and I have come out on the other side with knowledge and increased problem-solving abilities. As the curriculum unfolded, I could see exactly where I had gone wrong, what we could have done differently. So while [KALeidoscope](https://ether-cal-htg2021.netlify.app/) can easily be accessed in the world and [Race Stats Tracker](https://github.com/kristenkinnearohlmann/race-stats-tracker) is still just a GitHub repo that you have to clone and run yourself, the latter is the truest representation of who I am as a person invested with the enhanced skills of full-stack engineer and problem-solver.

I have earned both a bachelors and masters degree (in music), but once I pass this assessment and graduate from Flatiron, I will have achieved something new - knowledge and skills I really had to work for and couldn't just throw together in a practice room the week before the performance. And just as I do after I've run a marathon, I'm already planning how I will continue this development journey so that I never lose sight of what I've gained and I can continue to grow my knowledge.

I wish each and every person well, wherever they are on their journey. Sometimes we travel together, sometimes apart, but we never get there alone.
