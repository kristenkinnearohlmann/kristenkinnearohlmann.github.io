What a strange trip it's been!

I started the Rails module while waiting for my Sinatra assessment. I was a little nervous that concepts would start getting mixed up in my head but I knew my time is short to meet graduation requirements.

Although I felt very mighty in Sinatra, Rails was tripping me up a bit. After solving the environment issues I had through Ask A Question, I was glad to be working on Read Mes and Labs on my own machine but each new lesson I started didn't seem to gel with the one before as had been the case in all my learning to this point. There was quite a lot of the material that made sense right away or was a review but the lab would be springing a surprise on me. It felt very uncomfortable.

As I worked through the lessons, I noticed the labs were taking longer and longer. Previously, I had not despaired when this was the case but now I was starting to panic. I knew deep down that all of this would be helpful when I reached the project but I was seeing the images of calendar pages flying off the wall as if I was trapped in an old episode of the Twilight Zone.

Towards the end of the learning portion, I was soothed by meeting in study groups with coaches and fellow students. I had some surprisingly easy successes, like working with OmniAuth. When I tackled the Rails Amusement Park, I really felt like I had reached the point where I could work through solving problems and rubber-duck them to myself. I felt confident!

The requirements for the project sprung a couple surprises on me - what's this scope thing? Do I remember all these concepts? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?! I even had a return of Rails not working from a new project startup on my machine but by this point I knew I was prepared. I started hacking away at the problems and the issues and my project started to emerge.

For only the second time in this module, I felt great about searching for code, trying things, getting errors that I could understand and remedy. Lots of the time I was rocking out code, and when I hit a gut-wrenching problem, I sat down and worked on it anyway. Twice during my coding, I felt like I was slogging through mud for hours only to pop out on the other side and speed through a whole bunch of work like I was running downhill to the finish line.

Now it is late in the evening Central Time on the day before I had determined I wanted to complete so I had a hope of getting into Javascript and formally graduating from the program. Even if I need to take the assessment more than once, I am prepared to do what's needed and I have found the beauty and enjoyment of Rails. The advice that keeps serving me over and over again is to keep on going, never stop, never surrender.
